# music_bot
A lame attempt to create an IRC bot that informs the channel which music track you are listening to.

#### Notes

1. The Window Media Player (wmp) compatibility only works if you have the Now Playing XML ( https://github.com/fraggerfox/now_playing_xml ) plugin installed in wmp.

2. Currently supports Music Player Daemon (with mpc client installed) and Amarok player.
